# Cross-border Material Agent

Python 3.12 agent for the Qwen AI Arena cross-border e-commerce localization task.

## Runtime

The evaluator invokes:

```bash
python agent.py --prompt "...input path...output path..."
```

The agent discovers the product, category and attribute JSON files by schema; builds an evidence-backed fact ledger; resolves the AliExpress leaf category and enumerated attributes; creates English, Korean and Brazilian Portuguese descriptions; produces one main image, five deliberately distinct detail images and one video; then validates the complete delivery before exiting.

Localized copy uses a writer pass followed by a factual-auditor pass. Generated images are compared with trusted source images, near-duplicate details are replaced, and generated video is fully decoded and semantically reviewed before delivery.

Required environment variables:

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`
- `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `AGENT_LOG_DIR`

Optional model overrides:

- `AGENT_CHAT_MODEL`
- `AGENT_CHAT_FALLBACK_MODEL`
- `AGENT_IMAGE_MODEL`
- `AGENT_IMAGE_FALLBACK_MODEL`
- `AGENT_VIDEO_MODEL`

Defaults are `qwen3.8-max` for planning, localization and multimodal QA, `wan2.7-image-pro` for source-guided image generation, `qwen-image-3.0-pro` as the cross-model image fallback, and `wan2.7-i2v-2026-04-25` for video.

## Development smoke run

The input directory must contain exactly one product JSON. To use the supplied multi-product development dataset, select a product ID:

```bash
python agent.py \
  --input-dir Data_for_Users \
  --output-dir /tmp/material-agent-output \
  --product-id 3887087154767 \
  --offline
```

`--offline` skips model calls but still downloads supplied source URLs, produces localized fallback copy, normalizes images, creates a playable video, and executes all delivery gates.

## Build the submission

```bash
python scripts/build_submission.py
```

This downloads pinned CPython 3.12 manylinux x86_64 wheels, vendors Pillow and the ffmpeg fallback runtime, and creates `dist/agent.zip`. The ZIP has `agent.py` at its root and is rejected by the build script if it exceeds 100 MB.
